# Ball Collision
It is basically detecting when two balls touch each other. We can react to them in different ways if they touch each other.
For this project, the goal is to bounce balls each other at different directions and also bounce off the walls.

## All requirements and extra features have been implemented.
I have utilized elastic collision **One-dimensional Newtonian** formula.

Also, to calculate distance between two points, i have used **Pythagorean Theorem**. 

## Stress Test Result:
**Please Note:** This is based on my PC.

**Stress Test 1:** Balls: 1000 | Radius (in range): 5 to 10

**Stress Test 2:** Balls: 500 | Radius (in range): 5 to 20

**Stress Test 1:** Balls: 250 | Radius (in range): 10 to 30
